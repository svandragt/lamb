Branching Structure:
 - main branch: This is the main development branch where new features are implemented and merged.
 - release branch: This is the branch used to create and manage releases.

Other Branches:
 - next: allows targeting the next major version, when the next release is a bugfix one.
 - *-pinned: pinned branch, kept for reference reasons.

Default Branch:
 - The default branch should be main, as this is the branch where the active development and feature work is happening.
 - This allows for continuous integration and deployment of new changes, as the main branch represents the most up-to-date state of the project.

Release Process:
 - When you're ready to create a new release, you create a release branch from the main branch.
 - This allows you to maintain a stable release branch while development continues on the main branch.
 - After a release is made from the release branch, you may want to merge those changes back into the main branch to keep them in sync.

Branching Strategy Alignment:
 - This approach of using main for development and release for releases aligns with common Git branching strategies, such as Git Flow or GitHub Flow.
 - It provides a clear separation between the development work and the release process, which can make the overall workflow more manageable.
