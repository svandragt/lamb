# Themes

Lamb comes with two built in themes: `default` and `2024`.

* Default is a traditional blog theme
* 2024 is a more open modern theme.

To switch between themes assign the theme directory as the value to the `theme` key in the `config.ini`:

```ini
theme = 2024
```

Lamb also supports user themes in the same way. Simply create your own theme directory and assign it to the `theme` key.
